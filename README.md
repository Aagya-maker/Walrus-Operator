# Walrus-Operator
The Walrus Operator (:=) is a feature in Python that allows the assignment of values to variables as part of a larger expression. 



Code Example:


print(a := False)  # Output: False
print(b := 8)      # Output: 8
print(aagya := "name")
print(Happy := True)  # Output: True



Why the Name "Walrus"?
The syntax := resembles a walrus if you tilt your head to the right. This operator provides a convenient way to assign values within expressions, contributing to cleaner and more efficient code.
